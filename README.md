# ELEVATE-Task-8

In this task, we performed customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on the Mall Customers dataset. First, we loaded and explored the dataset, then visualized it using PCA for a 2D view. Next, we applied K-Means clustering after standardizing the data and assigned cluster labels. To determine the optimal number of clusters, we used the Elbow Method by plotting the WCSS for different values of K. After selecting the best K, we visualized the clusters with color coding and centroid markers on a PCA-reduced scatter plot. Finally, we evaluated the clustering performance using the Silhouette Score, which helped validate the quality and separation of the clusters.
